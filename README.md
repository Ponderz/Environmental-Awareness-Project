# Shipwrecked Project 1: Environmental Arcade & CO₂ Data Analysis

## Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

1. **Environmental Arcade (Python Turtle Games)**
    - **Polluted Water and Trees**: A two-player adaptation of Snakes and Ladders with an environmental theme.
    - **Hangtree**: A two-player adaptation of Hangman, using a tree instead of a hangman.
